Adds some features available trough the eve online IGB client.

== Description ==

This should help setting up a WordPress site for Eve Online player corporations.

Primary goals are ease of installation, configuration, while maintaing a high 
level of security and confidentiality.

Planned features and ideas are derived from what's missing in day-to-day 
management, operations and information flow in a Eve Online corporation. This 
means, if a feature is available elsewhere in a acceptable quality, this plugin
will not provide it. So no killboard, no maps, no market-data, no blueprint or 
mining calculations etc.

Planned features:
 * Support for Eve Online in-game browser (IGB) functionality.
 * Members registration with Eve Online API keys and account validation by wallet transaction.
 * No passwords. email-address or other personal or real-life information required.
 * Wordpress site roles and capabilities derived from Eve Online corporation titles and roles.
 * Uses Eve Online character portraits instead of Gravatar.
 * Timezone support for members.
 * Defaults to members-only for new blog posts and pages.
 * Shortcodes for in-game market-items, characters, corporations, stations, solar systems, etc.
 * Auto-generated user-list and user-pages/character-sheet (incl. alts used, time-zone).
 * GeoLocation
 
More ideas:

 * Wordpress theme with added functionality.
 * Support for alternate characters (alts).
 * Character sheet with optional additional user information:
  - Skills
  - Current skill-queue
  - Planned skills (Evemon upload/import)
 * bbPress Forum intergration
 * ICS calendar export from Eve Online
